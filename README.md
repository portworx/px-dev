# PX-Developer Beta 
PX-Developer is scale-out storage for containers. Deploying PX-Developer on a server with Docker Engine turns that server into a scale-out storage node. Storage runs converged on the same server as compute, giving bare-metal performance. 

PX-Developer aims to improve the storage experience for developer and DevOps teams using containers. This release is an open beta and we want to develop this solution with the community, as we shared on our [blog](http://portworx.com/px-dev-beta/). [Contact us](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev#contact-us) to share your feedback, work with us, and to request features. Stay tuned for updates on PX-Developer (PX-Dev for short) and our PX-Enterprise release. 

## Install and Quick Start Guides
As you develop and deploy your apps in containers, use PX-Dev for elastic storage capacity, managed performance, and high availability.

 * See our quick start guides on installing PX-Dev:
  * [Launching PX-Dev with Docker Compose](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev/blob/master/quick-start/README.md)  
  * [Detailed instructions for installing and Running PX-Dev on Ubuntu](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev/blob/master/install_run_ubuntu.md) or [Red Hat](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev/blob/master/install_run_rhel.md)
 * Run stateful containers with Docker volumes:
  * [Scaling a Cassandra database with PX-Dev](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev/blob/master/examples/cassandra_guide.md) 
  * [Running the Docker registry with high availability](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev/blob/master/examples/registry_guide.md) 
 * Use our [pxctl CLI ](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev/blob/master/cli_reference.md) to directly: 
  * View the cluster global capacity and health
  * Create, inspect, and delete storage volumes
  * Attach policies for IOPs prioritization, maximum volume size, and enable storage replication
 * Refer to the [Technical FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev/blob/master/faq.md) if you run into an issue. Please also feel free to [Contact us](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev#contact-us) as well. 
  

## Architecture and Storage
Portworx storage is deployed as a container and runs on a cluster of servers. Application containers provision storage directly through the Docker [volume plugins](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_volume/#command-line-changes:be52bcf493d28afffae069f235814e9f) API or the Docker [command-line](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_volume/#command-line-changes:be52bcf493d28afffae069f235814e9f). Administrators and DevOps can alternatively pre-provision storage through the Portworx command-line tool (pxctl) and then set storage policies using the Portworx administrative interface.

Portworx storage runs in a cluster of server nodes. 
 * Each server has the PX-Dev container and the Docker daemon.
 * Servers join a cluster and share configuration through the key/value store, such as etcd.
 * The PX-Dev container pools the capacity of the storage media residing on the server. You easily select storage media through the config.json file.

See [Deployment Requirements](https://github.com/portworx/px-dev#requirements-and-limitations) for compatibility requirements.

Storage volumes are thinly provisioned, using capacity only as an application consumes it. Volumes are replicated across the nodes within the cluster, per a volume’s configuration, to ensure high availability. 

Using MySQL as an example, a PX-Dev storage cluster has the following characteristics:
 * MySQL is unchanged and continues to write its data to /var/lib/mysql.
 * This data gets stored in the container’s volume, managed by PX-Dev. 
 * PX-Dev synchronously and automatically replicates writes to the volume across the cluster.

![fig2: MySQL volumes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portworx/px-dev/master/images/mysql.png)

Each volume specifies its request of resources (such as its max capacity and IOPS) and its individual requirements (such as ext4 as the file system and block size). 

Using IOPS as an example, a team can chose to set the MySQL container to have a higher IOPS than an offline batch processing container. Thus, a container scheduler can move containers, without losing storage and while protecting the user experience.

|Kernel Version|3.10 or higher|
|Docker Version|1.10 or higher|
|KV Database|Etcd 2.0 or higher.  See https://github.com/coreos/etcd or try a hosted version at https://compose.io/etcd/|
